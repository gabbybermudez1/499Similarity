        ''' Agricultural production systems are facing increasing competition from other sectors for
                limited natural resources. The availability of these resources and their quality are also being
                affected by unsustainable management practices and changing climatic and weather
                conditions. To respond to this situation, the agriculture sectors must improve their
                sustainability performance and adapt to the impacts of climate change in ways that do not
                compromise global efforts to ensure food security for all. These challenges are intimately and
                inextricably related, and need to be addressed simultaneously.

        	Agriculture is a highly multi-disciplinary field; students can expect to study mathematics, biology,
		chemistry, economics and sociology. It is vital to understand all of the factors that affect food
		sustainability and ensure or threaten food security.
